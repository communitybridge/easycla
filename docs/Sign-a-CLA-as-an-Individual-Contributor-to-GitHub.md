# Sign a CLA as an Individual Contributor to GitHub
As an individual contributor to an open-source project who is not associated to a company, you create a pull request in GitHub to inform code maintainers about changes made to the code. During the pull request process, your CLA is verified. Also during the process, you click a link to open the CLA Contributor Console to sign the CLA Agreement. As an individual contributor, your work is owned by yourself (Individual CLA).

**Do these steps:**

1. In GitHub, go to the repository that is linked to the project for your organization.

1. Make a change and send a pull request.

   EasyCLA checks the CLA status of all committers involved in that pull request. Easy CLA marks a cross or a tick beside contributor names who are involved in that pull request based on their CLA status.

   A cross next to your contributor name means the CLA check failed.
