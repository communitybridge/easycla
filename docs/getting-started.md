# Getting Started with EasyCLA

## What is EasyCLA?
**EasyCLA** helps maintainers of open source projects to streamline their workflows and reduce the hassle of managing Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) and authorizing contributors. 

By automating many of the manual processes, this open source solution hosted by the Linux Foundation reduces delays for developers to get authorized under a CLA. 

### How does it work?
Here’s a high level diagram that shows the different flows and roles that EasyCLA supports:

## Which Role are you?
EasyCLA supports the following roles in its workflow:

* [Project Manager](#project-manager)
* [CLA Manager](#cla-manager)
* [CLA Signatory](#cla-signatory)
* [Contributor](#contributor)

How you interact with EasyCLA depends on your role.

#### Project Manager
You are a Project Manager if you are the project maintainer responsible for selecting the appropriate Individual and Corporate CLA.  

Traditionally, the Project Manager has had to enforce whether a contributor was authorized to commit code to their project at every commit.  This would become especially cumbersome when getting signatures for Corporate CLAs from companies and updating each company’s whitelist of authorized developers.

With EasyCLA, your most common tasks will be:

* Select a CLA
* Select the projects

If you are using the LF-hosted service, you will login through: [https://project.lfcla.com/](https://project.lfcla.com/)

If you are hosting your own or using another deployment, find the login from the user.

#### CLA Manager
You are the CLA Manager if you’re the person authorized to manage who can contribute under your company’s Corporate CLA.  

With this responsibility, you are likely to use EasyCLA to:

* Add Companies
* Forward to Signatories
* Whitelist Contributors
* Manage Companies that have signed

If you are using the LF-hosted service, you will login through: [https://corporate.lfcla.com/](https://corporate.lfcla.com/)

If you are hosting your own, find out from the deployment where to login.

#### CLA Signatory
You are the CLA Signatory if you are the authorized signatory of the project’s CLA for the company.  Typically this will be someone within the counsel’s office of the company.

Within EasyCLA, you are most likely to:

* Receive an email asking you to sign the CLA
* Provide an electronic signature

If you are using the LF-hosted service, you will likely login through: [https://corporate.lfcla.com/](https://corporate.lfcla.com/)

If you are hosting your own, find out where to login from your admin.
