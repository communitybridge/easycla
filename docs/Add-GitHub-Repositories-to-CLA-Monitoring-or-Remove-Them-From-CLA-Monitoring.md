**Do these steps**:

1. Sign in.

2. Click a **project** of interest.

   The project page appears.

3. In the GitHub Repositories pane, click **CONFIGURE GITHUB REPOSITORIES**.

   The Configure GitHub Repositories dialog appears and lists the GitHub repositories that are available for your organization.

4. For the repository that you want to configure, click an option:

   **ADD** adds the repository to the CLA group and to CLA monitoring. After you add a repository, the REMOVE option becomes available next to the repository.

   **REMOVE** removes the repository from the CLA group and CLA monitoring. After you remove a repository, the ADD option appears next to the repository.

   DISABLED indicates that the repository has been configured for another CLA group, and thus cannot be configured for the selected CLA group. 

5. Click **CLOSE**.

   The CLA Management Console appears. Repositories shows a checkmark next to each repository that the EasyCLA Application will monitor for the organization and the CLA group.
