# Contribute to a GitHub Company Project
As a corporate (employee) contributor to an open-source project, you create a pull request in GitHub to inform code maintainers about changes made to the code. If any of your contributions to the project are created as part of your employment, the work may not belong to you—it may be owned by your employer. In that case, the CCLA signatory represents the employer (company) for legal reasons, and signs the Corporate Contributor Licensing Agreement in order for your contribution to be accepted into the company. During the pull request process, your CLA status is verified.

When all CLA management set-up tasks are complete and your CCLA signatory has signed a Corporate CLA, you simply confirm your association to the company during your first pull request. Then you can continue with your pull request. Your subsequent contributions will not require association confirmations.

**Do these steps:**

*If you are a project manager, make sure that you are logged out of the CLA Management Console before you begin.*

1. In GitHub, go to the repository that is linked to the project for your organization.

1. Make a change and send a pull request.

   EasyCLA checks the CLA status of all committers involved in that pull request. EasyCLA marks a cross or a tick beside contributor names involved in that pull request based on their CLA status.

   A cross next to your contributor name means the CLA check failed.
