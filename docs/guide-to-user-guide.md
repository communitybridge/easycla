# Guide to User Guide

## What is this?

For those who want to contribute, add, or modify the **User Guides** for the CommunityBridge suite of services.

This is the Contributor guideline for User Documentation.

## What Makes Good User Documentation?

Thinking about what helps the users get the most out of the product drives good user documentation.

This means having empathy and walking in their shoes.

### The Ultimate Litmus Test

Ask yourself: "As a brand new user, can I get what I want from the docs as clearly and quickly as possible?"

Here are questions and goals for Users:

#### Questons They are Likely Asking

* What does this product do?
* How do I get started?
* How do I do 'X'?
* Where do I go if I have more question?
* Is the product too complicated?
* Will this be hard to use?

#### Goals That They Have

* Find their complete answer in the shortest amount of time
* Have the ability to drill into complications

### Readability

#### Does it pass the 'scan' test?

Can the user quickly 'scan' to get search for what they want?

This can be in achieved by using:

* Clear headers
* Combining appropriate questions or actions as headers
* Succinct bullets
* Making bullets clickable \(when appropriate\)

#### Can users get a lay of the land?

The user usually has an "end-in-mind." They want to be able to "see" there's a complete pathway, perhaps the 'happy path' to get there so that they have a full context.

It's like using Google Maps: most people start by seeing the entire pathway from start to finish. Then when they actually start walking or driving, they see bits and pieces with more details.

This can be achieved by ensuring:

* Can a user complete a 'happy path' for a common user story easily \(in a single page\)
* Are there summaries that show key steps to take \(and the detailed steps are relatively intuitive?\)
* Are we describing end-goals as part of the documentation
* Is the writing concise?

### Navigation

Documentation should allow customers to get to where they want to go as quickly as possible. When you go through the flow, is it as fast as possible?

Some navigational options:

* [Links to new pages](guide-to-user-guide.md#links-to-new-pages)
* [Links to anchors](guide-to-user-guide.md#links-to-anchors)

#### Links to New Pages

Clicking through to a new page will increase latency. In some cases, it is still worth the entirely new context.

But that decision should be made with clarity and foresight.

#### Links to Anchors

Linking to an anchor is much faster. There is no need to render the page again.

The trade-off is that a given page could be way too sprawling and the content does, in fact, deserve a page of its own.

When writing the documentation, think about how content is "grouped" together by context.

For example: a **Getting Started** page should be an overview of the "greatest hits" and "happy paths." The content on **Troubleshooting** is different context for the user, and therefore deserves a different page.

Some items found on the **Troubleshooting** page probably could be linked to from **Getting Started**, however.

## Dating and Versioning

Good idea for the users \(and for the writers/contributors\) to indicate in the document versions and dates. Doesn't need to be that hard-core, but probably nice to do.
