## Featured lists

Featured lists are common marketing components used for associating visual icons with a list of topics.

{% example html %}
<div class="container-fluid">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <ul class="featured-list featured-list-bordered">
        <li class="m-b-md">
          <div class="featured-list-icon">
            <span class="icon icon-dropbox"></span>
          </div>

          <h3>Save things</h3>
          <p>
            Use dropbox to save things in the "cloud" because throwing things away is stressful and this way you don't have to.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div class="featured-list-icon">
            <span class="icon icon-github"></span>
          </div>
          <h3>Fork things</h3>
          <p>
            Use github to share things on the internet then change them. Make things better. Free software? But not as in beer.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <ul class="featured-list featured-list-bordered">
        <li class="m-b-md">
          <div class="featured-list-icon">
            <span class="icon icon-medium"></span>
          </div>

          <h3>Write things</h3>
          <p>
            Use Medium to write things down and sound smart. Also when you write, your writings looks pretty and that is cool.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div class="featured-list-icon">
            <span class="icon icon-twitter"></span>
          </div>
          <h3>Tweet things</h3>
          <p>
            Use twitter to share 140 characters worth of anything you want. Pictures, videos, etc. It doesn't really matter.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
