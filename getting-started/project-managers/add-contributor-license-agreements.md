# Add Contributor License Agreements

As a project manager, you use the CLA Management Console to add CLAs to CLA groups. The CLA Management Console lets you select a template style to use for your Corporate CLA and Individual CLA.

This is a sample sentence.

In some circumstances, you need to change the legal text of the CLA agreement in major and minor revisions:

* A major revision \(for example, a change to your charter\) is one in which you are legally required to have all contributors re-sign the revised agreement.
* A minor revision is one that does not change a legal perspective and contributors do not need to re-sign the revised agreement.

In these cases, you simply add the updated CLA using the same procedure as for adding the initial CLA.

2. Click a **project** of interest.

   The project page appears.

3. Go to the CLA group to which you want to add a CLA and click **SELECT TEMPLATE**.

   The Select a template page appears and lists available templates.

4. Click the **button** on the template you want to use.

   A template information form appears. The information you enter in this form will populate the corresponding fields in the resulting Corporate CLA and Individual CLA PDFs. The following form is an example; each form is specific to the project.
