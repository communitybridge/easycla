# Add GitHub Repositories to CLA Monitoring or Remove Them From CLA Monitoring

**Do these steps:**

2. Click a **project** of interest.

   The project page appears.

3. In the GitHub Repositories pane, click **CONFIGURE GITHUB REPOSITORIES**.

4. For the repository that you want to configure, click an option:

   **REMOVE** disables CLA enforcement on the repository. After you remove a repository, the ADD option appears next to the repository.

   **ADD ALL REPOS** adds all repositories for the corresponding GitHub Organization to CLA enforcement. After you add the repositories the REMOVE option appears next to each repository.

   DISABLED indicates that the repository has been configured for another CLA group and thus cannot be configured for the selected CLA group.

5. Click **CLOSE**.

   The CLA Management Console appears. Repositories shows a checkmark next to each repository that EasyCLA will monitor for the organization and the CLA group.
