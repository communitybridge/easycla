# Add GitHub Repositories to CLA Monitoring or Remove Them From CLA Monitoring

As a project manager, you can add GitHub repositories to CLA monitoring or remove them from CLA monitoring.

**Do these steps:**

1. [Sign in](sign-in-to-the-cla-management-console.md).
2. Click a **project** of interest.

   The project page appears.

3. In the GitHub Repositories pane, click **CONFIGURE GITHUB REPOSITORIES**.

   The Configure GitHub Repositories dialog appears and lists the GitHub repositories that are available for your organization.

4. For the repository that you want to configure, click an option:

**ADD** adds the repository to the CLA group and to CLA monitoring. After you add a repository, the REMOVE option becomes available next to the repository.

**REMOVE** removes the repository from the CLA group and CLA monitoring. After you remove a repository, the ADD option appears next to the repository.

**REMOVE** disables CLA enforcement on the repository. After you remove a repository, the ADD option appears next to the repository.

**ADD ALL REPOS** adds all repositories for the corresponding GitHub Organization to CLA enforcement. After you add the repositories the REMOVE option appears next to each repository.

**DISABLED** indicates that the repository has been configured for another CLA group and thus cannot be configured for the selected CLA group.

1. Click **CLOSE**.

   The CLA Management Console appears. Repositories shows a checkmark next to each repository that EasyCLA will monitor for the organization and the CLA group.
